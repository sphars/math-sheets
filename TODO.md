## Long-div notation

```
       32
    ┌─────
  8 │ 256

```

Priority:

- generate the "written" problem like above
- format it with padding
  - answer (quotient) is right-aligned with dividend
- enable the long-division checkbox only if division or mix is selected 
- test extreme values
  - problems will be wider so make sure the html and pdf are okay. adjust accordingly
- remainders formatting
  - answer would be 5 R 2 or something. Look up proper notation for remainder
