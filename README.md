# Math Sheets

Generating simple math worksheets in the browser for printing or whatever. Inspired by the worksheets my dad printed for my siblings and I during the summer breaks (remembering how it looked purely by memory).

Built using just HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript in a few hours. 

## Status

It's at the MVP stage right now, with a couple features still in-progress:

- Use alternative notations, such as the long-division notation
- Creating problems with randonly chosen operators
- Better styling
- Use JS library for better DOM manipulation
- Saving config via URL parameters

See [ISSUES](https://github.com/sphars/math-sheets/issues) for more details.
