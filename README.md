# Math Sheets

Generate PDF worksheets of simple math problems in the browser.

Inspired by the worksheets my dad printed off for my siblings and I during the summer breaks. I'm recreating this purely by memory; all I remember is that it was a grid of math problems, printed on a dot matrix printer. Not sure what he created his sheets in (likely QBasic or VisualBasic as this was late 1990s), so my attempt is to recreate this as close as possible, using modern web technologies.

Built with HTML, CSS and Typescript and Vite in (more than) a few hours. I'm also using this as an exercise to learn newer web technologies (like TS and Vite).

## Features

For generating the problems, there's several configuration options:

- Choose from the 4 operators to generate problems for, or use a mix of operators
- Set the min/max operand values (0-1000 inclusive, may adjust)
  - The two operand min/max values can be set independently
  - For division problems, the second operand is regenerated if it's 0 to avoid divide by zero problems
- Set the number of problems to generate
  - Currently I'm creating the PDF so that it fits 24 problems (4x6) per page, which may change
- Set the operand order (highest or lowest first)
- Option to not have negative answers, which overrides operand order to highest first (helpful with subtraction problems)
- Option to make answers be integers only (for division problems)
  - If unselected, then answers are rounded to 3 decimal places where needed
- Configuration options and resulting problems can be saved by using the same URL
  - When the problems are generated, the URL will add parameters to include what options are set and their values
  - When returning to the site with the same URL, the problems generated will be the same, handled by the `seed` value in the form. A different seed will generate different problems


For generating the PDFs, there's a couple options to change:

- Add the header to the first page
  - Header is simply `NAME: ________ DATE: ______`, like back in school
- Show the answers on the page (an answer sheet)

## Status

It's at the MVP stage right now with basic functionality available.

There are a couple features still in-progress:

- Better styling (like dark mode)
- Use alternative notations, such as the long-division notation
- Using custom fonts in the PDF (only Courier is available in the PDF for now)

See [ISSUES](https://github.com/sphars/math-sheets/issues) for details about upcoming features.

## Development

This site is built with Typescript and Vite. Only requirement is Node v20+. To run locally, clone the repo, then

```
cd math-sheets
npm install
npm run dev
```

The production build is just a static site. To build, run

```
npm run build
```

and the output `./dist` directory can be deployed where ever you'd like. See the `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` file for an example GitHub pages deployment.
