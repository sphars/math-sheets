# Math Sheets

Generating math worksheets in the browser, for printing or whatever.

Inspired by the worksheets my dad printed for my siblings and I during the summer breaks (purely by memory).

## Status

Built using just HTML, CSS and JavaScript in a few hours. It's at the MVP stage right now, with a couple features still in-progress:

- Rewriting division problems to use different notation, such as the long-division notation:
```
   31.75
 _______      
4)127.00
```
- Creating problems using mix of operators
- Additional options
- Styling
- Rewriting using some JS library for better management of DOM manipulation


## Credits

- [Dotrice](https://www.1001fonts.com/dotrice-font.html) (dot matrix style font) by Paul Flo Williams, modified by me to add some additional characters:
  - Division Sign `รท`
  - Multiplication Sign `ร`
- [Glyphr Studio](https://www.glyphrstudio.com/) for font editing
